Conway's Game of Life (Haskell)
Author: Jim Tao

This program implements Conway's Game of Life.
It reads a 0-1 matrix from stdin and simulates
Conway's Game of Life on that initial state,
interpreting 0's to be dead cells and 1's to
be live cells. 

Example usage:

% echo [[0,0,1,0],[1,0,0,1],[1,0,0,1],[0,1,0,0]] | ./gameoflife
% ./gameoflife < gun.txt

Compilation instructions: 

To compile, use the command
% make all

Note:
0-1 matrices can be generated
by issuing the following command:

% ./01matrix 23 80 < /dev/urandom

Thus the following command executes Conway's Game of Life
on a randomly generated array:

% ./01matrix 23 80 < /dev/urandom | ./gameoflife

A simple shell script titled script does this very thing.
To execute it, type in the command

% ./script
